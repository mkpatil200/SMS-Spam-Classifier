# SMS-Spam-Classifier

## Problem Statement
Need to analyse the dataset and predict the SMS received is a Ham or Spam 

## Dataset Information
The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.

## Libraries
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. nltk
6. sklearn

## Algorithms
1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN
3. SVC
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. Naive Bayes
7. Ada Boosting
8. Gradinent Boosting
9. XGB Boosting

## Conclusion
1. From the EDA performed on the dataset it can be conclude that number of characters, words and sentences used in Ham messages are more as compared with spam messages.

2. From the heat map performed to check the correlation, we see that our Target column has the higest correlation with the number of characters used in the text. 

3. After applying the set of algorithm along with the tuning of models, the best accuracy was found with Multinominal Naive Bayes. 

## Best Accuracy: 97.29

## Best Precision: 1.0
